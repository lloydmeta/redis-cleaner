Redis-Cleaner
-------------

A simple way of cleaning up a large number of Redis keys via [pattern matching](http://redis.io/commands/keys)

Example Usage
=========

Instantiating a redis_cleaner

```ruby
# Timeout needs to be set, because KEYS is run on the Redis-server
# side, which is potentially slow -> O(n) where n is the number of keys
redis_config = {
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 6390,
  timeout: 60
}

redis_cleaner = RedisKeyCleaner.new(Redis.new(redis_config), "./borked_keys")
```

Separate dumping and cleaning

```ruby
redis_cleaner.dump_matching_keys_to_temp_file("resque:resque-retry*") #<-- can be skipped if you already have a file to read from
cleanup_job_stats = redis_cleaner.delete_keys_in_temp_file(verbose: false)
puts "Deleted #{cleanup_job_stats[:deleted_keys_count]} keys out of #{cleanup_job_stats[:total_keys_count]}"
```

Do everything in one go

```ruby
redis_cleaner.dump_matching_keys_to_temp_file("resque:resque-retry*", delete_temp_file: false, verbose: false, batch_size: 200)
```
