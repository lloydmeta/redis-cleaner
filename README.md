Redis-Cleaner [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/redis-cleaner.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/redis-cleaner) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/lloydmeta/redis-cleaner.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/lloydmeta/redis-cleaner)
-------------

A simple way of cleaning up a large number of Redis keys via [pattern matching](http://redis.io/commands/keys). Compatible with any Redis client for Ruby that responds in the same way as the official Redis client for Ruby does to the 2 methods: #del and #keys. These include but are not limited to:

  - [Redis-rb](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb)
  - [hiredis-rb](https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-rb)
  - [redis_failover](https://github.com/ryanlecompte/redis_failover)

Why not juse use the CLI?
================

In most cases, you can probably get away with doing `$redis-cli KEYS "pattern:*" | xargs redis-cli DEL` !

_But_ if you have a huge number of keys returned by the pattern (the use case of this gem is the handle 5 million+ keys that dumped into a 2GB file) and the keys are generated by something like the awesome [resque-retry](https://github.com/lantins/resque-retry), resulting in strings that are not only long but also possibly filled with strange characters, you might want to use this tool to help cut the operation into multiple smaller chunks so you don't worry about escaping, Redis timeouts / service disruption, etc.

Installation
=======
    $ gem install redis-cleaner

or add to your ``Gemfile``

    gem 'redis-cleaner'

and install it with

    $ bundle install

Example Usage
=========

Instantiating a redis_cleaner

```ruby
require 'redis'
require 'redis_cleaner'

# Timeout needs to be set, because KEYS is run on the Redis-server
# side, which is potentially slow -> O(n) where n is the number of keys
redis_config = {
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 6390,
  timeout: 60
}

# Any Redis connection (as noted above) will do, here we just use the normal Redis RB client
redis_connection = Redis.new(redis_config)
redis_cleaner = RedisCleaner.new(redis_connection, "./borked_keys")
```

Separate dumping and cleaning

```ruby
redis_cleaner.dump_matching_keys_to_temp_file("resque:resque-retry*") #<-- can be skipped if you already have a file to read from
cleanup_job_stats = redis_cleaner.delete_keys_in_temp_file(verbose: false)
puts "Deleted #{cleanup_job_stats[:deleted_keys_count]} keys out of #{cleanup_job_stats[:total_keys_count]}"
```

Do everything in one go (dumps to file and deletes the file by default)

```ruby
redis_cleaner.dump_and_delete("resque:resque-retry*", delete_temp_file: false, verbose: false, batch_size: 200)
```
